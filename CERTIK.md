# For Certik teams

## Introduction

Thanks for the audit of our smart contracts and waiting for a long time for this integration work.

This repository is UsePAY's smart contract projects containing UsePAY's Solidity codes.

We looking forwards to this project could be helping your team's assessment works to be easier than before.

## The target contracts

The smart contracts separated by multiple network source codes have been integrated into one.

For instance, The Commander contracts existed in three separate files however now,  integrated into one file and Our governance token name was changed to PAC from DFM.

The integrated source codes, target source codes for audit, exist in the `./UsePAY/contracts/UsePAY` directory.

Please only assess smart contracts in this directory.

Thank you.
